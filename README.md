## Additional Information ℹ️

### Supabase Integration 🔗

This boilerplate provides a basic setup for integrating Supabase into your app. Supabase is an open-source alternative to Firebase that provides a scalable and secure backend for your applications.

To use Supabase in your project, follow these steps:

1. Open the `src/utils/supabase.ts` file.
2. This file exports the Supabase client instance, which is configured to use the Supabase environment variables specified in the `.env` file.
3. You can import and use this client instance in your components and modules to interact with your Supabase backend.
4. Refer to the Supabase documentation (https://supabase.io/docs) for more details on how to use the client and perform various operations.
